# 🐍 100 Days of Python Projects  

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python Projects** repository!  
This repo is a collection of projects I built every day for 100 days — starting from simple beginner scripts to advanced applications with APIs, data science, and web development.  

## 🎯 Why this repo?  
- To strengthen my Python foundations.  
- To build consistency & discipline (coding every day for 100 days).  
- To challenge myself under stress and prove perseverance + determination.  
- To showcase my growth from **scratch → advanced developer**.  

## 🛠️ Project Categories  
- ✅ Beginner Projects (games, scripts, utilities)  
- ✅ Automation & APIs (web scraping, Spotify, weather, etc.)  
- ✅ GUI & Games (Tkinter, pygame apps)  
- ✅ Data Science & Visualization (EDA, dashboards, ML basics)  
- ✅ Web Apps & Deployment (Flask/Django, FastAPI, final capstone apps)  

## 🚀 Final Goal  
By the end of these 100 days, this repo will represent **100 completed projects** that highlight my determination, problem-solving skills, and love for Python ❤️.
